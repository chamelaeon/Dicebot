ReflectionError: Something deep inside me hurts now. Why did you do that?

# Commands

# Basic Rolling
LessThanOneGroup: If you roll no groups, you get no dice. If you have no dice, then no dice. 
Roll0Dice: Rolling no dice means you get nothing. Enjoy that.
CannotSatisfyRerollSingleDie: It seems that the reroll condition %REROLL% can't be met by a die with %SIDES% sides. I suggest you die instead.
CannotSatisfyRerollMultipleDice: It seems that the reroll condition %REROLL% can't be met by %DICEROLLED% dice with %SIDES% sides. I suggest you die instead.
InfiniteExplosion: Well, those dice explode infinitely, so I'm going to tell you to piss off.
CannotSatisfySuccesses: You'll never get %SUCCESSESNEEDED% successes off %DICEROLLED% dice. Come back when you're ready to play seriously.
